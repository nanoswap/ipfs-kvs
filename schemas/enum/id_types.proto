// This is the list of all possible types of goverment issued IDs

// The naming syntax (country__level__name) is for readability only,
// because not every country has the same types of "levels" of issuers
// so to compare all government issued IDs apples to apples, they are listed flat-ly
// new IDs can always be added as governments collapse (and are replaced by new governments 
// who issue new ID types) or for regulatory changes
